# simple-react-app


Creating React App

    $ npx create-react-app my-sexy-app
  
Open It

    $ cd my-sexy-app
  
    $ npm start
  
Add Package

    $npm install ...
  
Make It Hostable

    .../my-sexy-app$ npm run build
  
    ($npm run my-sexy-build  -et cetera couldn't work-)
  
Host It On Github (or Somewhere)

  Create a github repo and name it eyupbey.github.io .Some sources say you have to use your name as subdomain but I haven't try another way yet.
  
  Copy the files under the build file one by one and paste it to the repo like using repo.
